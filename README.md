1. calculator.htmlDevelop a calculator with basic functions like addition, subtraction, mul- tiplication, division. One should be able to clear the values also, so that it is reusable.

For this we are expecting six (activity buttons) : addition, subtraction, summation of numbers up to n, multiplication of numbers up to n, = (to see the result of any calculation), and clear button(to clear the data, this may have different name).

Other buttons are for ten digits : 0-9; in total 4 + 10 + 2 = 16 buttons, if you want more you can use it.

Check if the calculations are correct for at least 4 digit numbers. What we are looking for is, we should be able to do a sequence of computations like this 123+456−456−32−2+12.Associativity of operators should be correct.
